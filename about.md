Hello!

My name is Jessica Quynh Tran. I am a web developer focused on javascript and
AngularJS development. Based out of Montreal, I am a part-time student
studying Computer Science & Physics at McGill University.

I have a deep, deep affection for language, poetry, & literature. I like to call
myself a hobbyist philosopher. Equipped with a layman's interest in psychology,
neuroscience, & philosophy, you'll find me sloughing through academic papers
that are _way_ over my head and then eventually trying to find a YouTube video
on the subject instead.

This is a blog dedicated to my personal learning & discoveries in
programming. It is subdivided into few parts:
  - Learning (which are generally, uninteresting notes for my personal reference)
  - Project Development (reports and updates to track projects)
    + _Currently_: Outreachy Internship (writing each fortnight's progress)
  - Personal/Misc (a catch-all category for "everything else")

This blog uses the [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll) static page generator.

You can find my source code on my {% include icon-github.html username="jessicaquynh" %}/ [jessicaquynh.github.io](https://github.com/jessicaquynh/jessicaquynh.github.io).
