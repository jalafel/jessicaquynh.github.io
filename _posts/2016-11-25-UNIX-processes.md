In continuation to my compilation of notes about child processes in nodejs.
I recognized that I knew next to nothing about UNIX, or processes. I was really
just jotting down notes verbatim. So instead, I downloaded a PDF and got
cracking.

I don't know about anyone else, but I find programming texts can be a bit dry
and disengaging. I found myself zoning out or reading text without comprehending
the words. Eventually, I realized that I'd benefit from a visual note-taking
methodology and switched over.

It was fun exercise because processes in UNIX follows a tree-like structure and
its ontology is family-like (in a human sense). So, while there are still exists
large, daunting gaps in my knowledge, I think I've obtained a trivial
understanding of where processes fit into the operating system!

Which lands me further than I was yesterday. Yay :)

Here are my visual notes:

#### Unix Processes 1

<em>1. Overview of Kernel & Processes, how they communicate</em>

#### Unix Processes 2
{% include image.html path="unix_processes_2.jpg" path-detail="unix_processes_2.jpg" alt="Visual note two" %}
<em>2. Program vs. Process</em>

#### Unix Processes 3
{% include image.html path="unix_processes_3.jpg" path-detail="unix_processes_3.jpg" alt="Visual note three" %}
<em>3. Properties of a Process</em>
