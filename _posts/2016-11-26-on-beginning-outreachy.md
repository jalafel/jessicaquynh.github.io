I am incredibly pleased to be writing this post. Outreachy, an organization
that helps support underrepresented groups of people to get involved with
open-source software, has accepted me to be a part of their
Winter internship (December 2016 - March 2017). I'm ecstatic, nervous, and
incredibly grateful for this opportunity.

I'll be working with [node.js], to help land and test a cross-platform serial
communication implementation to improve native compatibility between [libuv],
[node-serial], and [node.js].

My mentor, [Myles Borins], has been a real angel to me since the very beginning
of the application process. He's been a gracious, considerate, & kind
human-being. He's assisted me with all the aspects of the Outreachy program and
has responded to every technical question I have. He's just been great.

He is based out of NYC and recommended a conference called [AlterConf]. A tech
conference meant to bring historically minority voices in tech onto stage. I'm
pretty sure I read the synopsis of the link Myles sent and immediately yelled
"YES" to myself. Alone. In my apartment. Gesticulating excitedly. Have you
gotten the visual, yet? Because I could go on ... Anyways, we booked the
tickets and we'll be having our very first meet outside of our tiny little
laptop screens in December!

[Francis Gulotta], who built and maintains [node-serialport], is also based out
of New York, so we will be planning for a meet up to talk about the project's
roadmap. I'm super excited to get started, meet & talk with all these different
developers and programmers.

I've mostly been writing front-end code for the better part of the year,
primarily focused in AngularJS. It's been an entirely different gear to be in
learning mode, and spending so much time researching to push forward a single
line of code. (Not to say it hasn't been an enjoyable process.)

I've been trying to angle my way into contributing to node.js in-between
classes & studying. Picking up a few loose and easy contributions has been my
go-to strategy as a fun, proactive excuse to understanding the varying
components of node.js without getting too overwhelmed by its entirety.

I basically know next to nothing. I totally understand I am at level zero, 100%
internship mode. But my goal for the future is that I open up a PR that has
something of value, or something of my own creation.

Hope to see you on the other side!
