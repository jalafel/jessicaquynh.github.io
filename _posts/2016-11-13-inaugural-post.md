This is the first post of my blog. I am excited to start writing regularly to an
audience of one to none. Look forward to personal thoughts, lots of dry notes,
and a bundle of progress reports that usually stay in the echo chasm of my own
brain and now for the first time is hitting the public sphere!

__Looking forward__ to lessening my generous usage of "looking forward" to end
any form of communications including:
  - email
  > Looking forward to {your response, working with you, hearing from you, etc.}
  - text
  > Looking forward to {our date, doing that thing, reading/listening/watching
  to that thing that you either sent or promise to send}
  - the grocery store
  > Looking forward to {seeing you next time, when you have ripe bananas in
  stock, the time I am not buying pounds of chocolate}
  - god
  > Looking forward to {verifying your existence, chillin'}
  - ad nauseum
  > The use cases are endless.

So accordingly, I am signing off with a simple:

Until next time! Bye!
