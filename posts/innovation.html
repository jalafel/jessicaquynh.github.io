            <p>There has always existwed a tension between innovation and history. Even in terms
of physical dynamics. The former is divined to move forward, imagining and
usurping the future, while the latter is analyzing and uncovering the past.</p>

<p>In my studies and research into UNIX, I cannot help but to consider the way in
which current technologies are built upon &amp; are interconnected with one another.</p>

<p>We have an engine like V8 that runs and compiles JavaScript to native machine
code, which is written in C++. But then how does C++ run and compile? With
a computer program also written in a unique programming language. What and how
does it run? These questions cascade endlessly.</p>

<p>I recall a conversation I had recently about algorithmic design and current
technologies. How each breed, or iteration of tech nowadays is an improved and
faster version of the other. I suppose, while this is true, I cannot help but
to notice that all things return back to a trivial and fundamental operational
set of procedures.</p>

<p>The reason to why I began writing this post was to note, truly, how science
and innovation only propels itself forward upon the broadened understanding of
the world and its formation — whether by mathematical structures or social
impulses.</p>

<p>Naturally there are edge cases of “serendipity” — but I am beginning to wonder
if there truly exists such a thing. Wouldn’t it be reasonable to consider that
a person of a fairly robust set of habits, existing in a fairly predictable
environment, is bound to end up in a certain outcome or create a certain product
given continuous performances?</p>

<p>The way that we formulate a story, or a narrative that binds together a
scientific discovery is the very the structure that conveys meaning and
significance. Humans have a natural persuasion for compelling narratives. And
what can make a story compelling and meaningful is the effect in which its
consequence has on the listener. That can mean its affect on an ecosystem in
which they exist; or a part of an ecosystem, which as we know, begins to affect
the larger system.</p>

<p><a href="Expansion: Consider listening to On Being with physicist, Leonard Mlodinow.
On randomness and free-will."></a></p>

<p>In the reocurrence of an item, or a formula, we see its created meaning from
repitition. We know something like Pythagoreom Thereom is Very Important because
it appears in almost every form of mathematics and physics. It enhances our
understanding of higher level mathemetical practices.</p>

<p>I can’t help but to think of the way these important patches, concepts, stay
almost static. And then, the world around it begin to expand, contract, extend
and adapt to these important fixtures.</p>

<h1 id="why-does-this-matter">Why does this matter?</h1>

<p>It allows me to think about the world, these invisible structures, scientific,
political, and all else, as a <strong><em>rhizome</em></strong>. And somewhere in all of it, we are
being. Naturally, all these structures pull and tug on who we are. Yet we lack
the ability to trace these lines.</p>

<p>I am interested in patterns. Namely, how we are consistently attempting to
program the world. In a way, these are questions about creativity within
programming. Does the world exist for us to recreate? And does it bring us any
closer to knowing the infinitisemal components any more by mimicking it with
our own set of languages and procedures, rather than ruthless dissection?</p>

<p>Now don’t get me wrong, I don’t really believe we are programming the world. I
have been corrected to know that what has been achieved in computer programming
is merely a trivial replication of highly complex, dynamic and unknown systems.</p>

<p>What I find interesting in how we are going about it, and this framework of
programming necessarily aids me to think about epistemology. Consider how
spoken and written language functions: one could argue that beyond the strings
of syllables, semiotics, phonemes, all of which makes up language, each without
a fluent observer, is utterly meaningless.</p>

<p>Yet, because we are able to attribute meaning to each distinct symbol. Different
meanings emerge upon assembly and variation of the any number of symbols taken
from our predefined set, it becomes powerful.</p>

<p>Additionally, if we have access to all these levels we can trace a meaning to be
a shadow of another. Origins of the words in latin, or Chinese symbols that echo
the phyical object its attempting to sign. It gets closer to its intended
expression.</p>

<p>I do not see a dissimilarity with code. Looking into low-level languages
inspires me to think about these things only because of its nearness to humanity.</p>

<p>In UNIX especially, we have language and terms that are pulled from human
behaviourisms, actions, and scenarios to describe its mechanics. When at its
root, it is simply a sequence of binary strings. This nearness and specifically,
its youngness (thus its ease of analogy), compels me to ponder on older systems of thought and whether or not they share this Darwinian
expansion.</p>

<p>Of course, the origins of thought and matter extend further than 1969, and
through evolution and iteration, have become completely indecipherable, but it
makes me wonder what exists at the root of language and thought. What are the
signals that have created <strong>everything</strong>?</p>
