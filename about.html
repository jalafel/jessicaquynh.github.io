  <h1>About me</h1>
  
  <p>
    My name is Jessica Quynh Tran. I am a web developer focused on javascript and AngularJS development. Based out of Montreal, I am a part-time student studying Computer Science and Physics at McGill University.
  </p>
  
  </br>

  <p>
    I have a great affection for language, poetry, and literature. I like to call myself a hobbyist philosopher. Equipped with a layman's interest in psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy, you'll find me sloughing through academic papers (which typically ends up as a YouTube video instead).

    This is a blog dedicated to my personal learning and discoveries in programming. It is subdivided into few parts:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Learning (which are generally, uninteresting notes for my personal reference)
      </li>
      <li>
        Project Development (reports and updates to track projects)
        <ul>
          <li>Outreachy Internship (writing each fortnight's progress)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Personal/Misc (a catch-all category for "everything else")</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
